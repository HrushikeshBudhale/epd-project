ELECTRONIC PRODUCT DESIGN 1

This project aim towards creating a product for framers. This can easily be 
created and installed in the field using some low cost and easily available
hardware. And can help farmers in getting current status of the field and 
setting required threshold parameters remotely.


This project requires components:
    
    1. Arduino UNO micro-controller
    2. DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity sensor)
    3. sim900 GSM module
    4. DS1307 (Real time clock)
    5. Soil Moisture Sensor
    6. Relay (for controlling AC appliances) / or LEDs for testing
    
Connection:

    GSM pin TX -----> Arduino pin 0 (RXD)
    GSM pin RX -----> Arduino pin 1 (TXD)
    DHT22      -----> Arduino pin 2
    Soil mois. -----> Arduino pin A0
    sensor
    RTC pin SDA-----> Arduino pin A4 (SDA)
    RTC pin SCL-----> Arduino pin A4 (SCL)
    Relay 1    -----> Arduino pin 13
    (Water Pump)
    Relay 2    -----> Arduino pin 12
    (Farm Lights)
    
Features:
    1. Only one switch present on the device (power switch).
        Any desired setting can be done remotely through smart phone as well as
        old mobile phones with keypad.
    2. 2 sheduled tasks including start and stop event.
        (e.g. turning water Pump ON at 5:00am)
    3. Trigger most used events using simple keypad buttons. 
    4. Turn Off/On sheduled task.
    5. Check current status of farm, anytime with just a missed call.
    6. Remote Programming(by sending SMS) functionality for:
        a. Setting current time.
            (e.g. set time = 25.02.17.10.45.52)
        b. Setting time for start and stop event for each task.
        c. Setting threshold for Temperature, Humidity or Moisture Sensors.
            (e.g. set temp threshold = 29)
        d. Setting on time for events.
        e. Setting sampling interval for data logging.
    7. compact design which can fit in volume of 15 X 10 X 5 cm.
    
    
Future Scope Includes:
    1. Interface with IOT for data logging.
    2. Dynamically setting thresholds and events considering information
        from weather forcast.
    3. Network and communication of multiple sensors in large field
        for more precise planning.
